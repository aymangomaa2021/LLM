Executive acknowledges that the consideration received by Executive under the Subscription Agreement and the\nEmployment Agreement and otherwise resulting from the agreement of The Heritage Group, an Indiana general partnership, and certain of its\naffiliates, partners and their beneficiaries (collectively, “Heritage”) to organize Crystal Clean, is good and sufficient consideration for Executive’s\ncovenants, agreements and forebearances contained in this Agreement and that Heritage would not have organized Crystal Clean and allowed\nExecutive to subscribe for Units but for Executive’s entering into this Agreement.\n(2) Non-Disclosure. Executive will not, at any time following this date except as required by the duties of his employment with Crystal Clean\nand/or its subsidiaries, disclose to any person, firm or corporation, any confidential information concerning Crystal Clean or its assets or\nbusiness, except as may be required by governmental law or regulation or in legal proceedings to which Executive is subpoenaed to give\ntestimony, in which event Executive shall notify Crystal Clean immediately upon learning that Executive may be required or compelled to\ndivulge any confidential information.

Executive may, without causing Executive to be in breach of this Agreement, enter into other business endeavors during\nthe Restricted Period or may engage in the Business outside of the Territory; provided that Executive’s other permitted services will not be\ndeemed to allow Executive to use or disclose “Confidential Information” in contravention of this Agreement or other agreements between\nExecutive and Crystal Clean.

This Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is executed upon EMPLOYEE's bona fide\nadvancement with NIKE and is a condition of such advancement. Employee acknowledges that he/she was\ninformed in a written job offer at least two weeks before starting work in his/her new position that this\nCovenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is required and is a condition of advancement.\nB. Over the course of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE, EMPLOYEE will be or has been exposed to and/or\nis in a position to develop confidential information peculiar to NIKE's business and not generally known to\nthe public as defined below (""Protected Information""). It is anticipated that EMPLOYEE will continue to be\nexposed to Protected Information of greater sensitivity as EMPLOYEE advances in the company, and this\nAgreement will remain in effect in the event EMPLOYEE advances and until EMPLOYEE leaves the\ncompany or it is superseded by a new written agreement executed by the parties.\nC. The nature of NIKE's business is highly competitive, and disclosure of any Protected Information would\nresult in severe damage to NIKE and be difficult to measure.\nD. NIKE makes use of its Protected Information throughout the world. Protected information of NIKE can be\nused to NIKE’s detriment anywhere in the world.\nAGREEMENT:\nIn consideration of the foregoing, and the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows:\n1. Covenant Not to Compete\n(a) Competition Restriction. During EMPLOYEE’s employment at NIKE, under the terms of any employment\ncontract or otherwise, and for one (1) year thereafter (the ""Restriction Period""), EMPLOYEE will not directly\nor indirectly own, manage, control or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed\nby, consult for or be connected in any manner\nwith, any business engaged anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear, athletic apparel or sports\nequipment, sports electronics/technology and sports accessories business, or any other business that\ndirectly competes with NIKE or any of its parent, subsidiaries or affiliated corporations (a ""Competitor""). This\nprovision is subject to NIKE's option to waive all or any portion of the Restriction Period as more specifically\nprovided below.\n(b) Extension of Time. In the event EMPLOYEE breaches this covenant not to compete, the Restriction Period\nshall automatically toll from the date of the first breach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of\nthe breach through private settlement, judicial or other action, including all appeals. The Restriction Period\nshall continue upon the effective date of any such settlement, judicial or other resolution. NIKE shall not be\nobligated to pay EMPLOYEE the additional compensation described in paragraph 1.1 below during any\nperiod of time in which this Agreement is tolled due to EMPLOYEE's breach. In the event EMPLOYEE\nreceives such additional compensation after any such breach, EMPLOYEE must immediately reimburse\nNIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a written request by NIKE.\n(c) Waiver of Non-Compete. NIKE has the option, in its sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the\nRestriction Period or to limit the definition of Competitor by giving EMPLOYEE seven (7) days' prior notice of\nsuch election. In the event all or a portion of the Restriction Period is waived or the definition of Competitor is\nlimited, NIKE shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE for any period of time as to which the covenant not to\ncompete has been waived.\n(d) Additional Consideration. As additional consideration for the covenant not to compete described above,\nshould NIKE terminate EMPLOYEE's employment without cause and elect to enforce the non-competition\nagreement, while the Restriction Period is in effect, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to\none hundred percent (100%) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly base salary. Except where prohibited by law, if\nNIKE terminates EMPLOYEE for ""cause,"" no additional consideration will be owed to EMPLOYEE under this\nAgreement, and the covenant not to compete will remain enforceable. For purposes of this Agreement only,\n""cause"" shall mean (i) insubordination, (ii) acts of dishonesty, (iii) involvement in illegal activities where such\ninvolvement in illegal activities violates NIKE policies, places NIKE at risk or has or could damage NIKE's\nreputation in the community or any of its related or subsidiary companies, (iv) violation of NIKE's anti-\nharassment or anti-discrimination policy or (v) gross neglect of EMPLOYEE'S duties or willful misconduct\nthat, in either case, results in economic harm to NIKE or harm to NIKE's reputation. Nothing in this\nparagraph or Agreement alters the employment-at-will relationship between NIKE and EMPLOYEE.\nIf EMPLOYEE voluntarily terminates employment and NIKE elects to enforce the non-competition\nagreement, while the Restriction Period is in effect, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a monthly payment equal to\nthe greater of fifty percent (50%) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly base salary or the equivalent of one-twelfth\n(1/12) of fifty percent of the median family income for a four-person family in the state where EMPLOYEE\nresides, as determined by the U.S . Census Bureau for the most recent year available at the time of\nEMPLOYEE's termination. The first payment to EMPLOYEE of additional consideration shall follow on the\nlast business day of the month after NIKE's election to enforce the non-competition agreement. Subsequent\npayments during the Restriction Period shall be payable monthly on the last business day of the month in\naccordance with NIKE's payroll practices.\n(e) Withholding and Offset. NIKE reserves the right to withhold from Additional Consideration payable to\nEMPLOYEE all federal, state and local taxes as shall be required, as well as any other amounts authorized\nor required by NIKE policy. NIKE reserves the right, exercisable in its sole discretion, to reduce the amount\nof Additional Consideration by amounts that EMPLOYEE owes NIKE, including but not limited to any\npayments due to NIKE in accordance\nwith the NIKE Tax Equalization Policy if EMPLOYEE is employed as a transferee during his or her\nemployment with NIKE. Employee agrees that notwithstanding the amount of any withholding and/or offset,\neven in an amount that reduces payments of Additional Consideration to zero dollars ($0.00), the covenant\nnot to compete will remain enforceable. To the extent withholding or offset does not extinguish amounts that\nEMPLOYEE owes to NIKE, EMPLOYEE remains obligated for the balance of the amounts owed.\n2. Subsequent Employer. EMPLOYEE agrees to notify NIKE at the time of separation of employment of the name\nof EMPLOYEE's new employer, if known. EMPLOYEE further agrees to disclose to NIKE the name of any\nsubsequent employer during the Restriction Period, wherever located and regardless of whether such employer\nis a competitor of NIKE.\n3. Non-Disclosure Agreement\n(a) Protected Information Defined. ""Protected Information"" shall mean all proprietary information, in whatever\nform and format, of NIKE and all information provided to NIKE by third parties that NIKE is obligated to keep\nconfidential. EMPLOYEE agrees that any and all information to which EMPLOYEE has access concerning\nNIKE projects and internal NIKE information is Protected Information, whether in verbal form, machine-\nreadable form, written or other tangible form, and whether designated as confidential or unmarked. Without\nlimiting the foregoing, Protected Information includes trade secrets and competitively sensitive business or\nprofessional information (regardless of whether such information constitutes a trade secret) relating to\nNIKE's research and development activities, its intellectual property and the filing or pendency of patent\napplications, confidential techniques, methods, styles, designs, design concepts and ideas, customer and\nvendor lists, contract factory lists, pricing information, manufacturing plans, business and marketing plans or\nstrategy, product development plans, product launch plans, financial information, sales information, methods\nof operation, manufacturing processes and methods, products and personnel information.\n(b) Excluded Information. Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a), Protected Information excludes any information\nthat is or becomes part of the public domain through no act or failure to act on the part of EMPLOYEE.\nSpecifically, EMPLOYEE shall be permitted to retain as part of his or her personal portfolio copies of\nEMPLOYEE's original artwork and designs, provided EMPLOYEE presents those personal portfolio copies\nto his or her supervisor for review and approval and provided the artwork or designs have become part of the\npublic domain. In any dispute between the parties with respect to this exclusion, the burden of proof will be\non EMPLOYEE, and such proof will be by clear and convincing evidence.\n(c) Employee's Obligations. During the period of employment by NIKE and for a period of two (2) years\nthereafter, EMPLOYEE will hold in confidence and protect all Protected Information and will not, at any time,\ndirectly or indirectly, use any Protected Information for any purpose outside the scope of EMPLOYEE's\nemployment with NIKE or disclose any Protected Information to any third person or organization without the\nprior written consent of NIKE. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, EMPLOYEE will not ever copy,\ntransmit, reproduce, summarize, quote, publish or make any commercial or other use whatsoever of any\nProtected Information without the prior written consent of NIKE. EMPLOYEE will also take reasonable\nsecurity precautions and such other actions as may be necessary to ensure that there is no use or\ndisclosure, intentional or inadvertent, of Protected Information in violation of this Agreement.\n4. Return of Protected Information. At the request of NIKE at any time, and in any event, upon termination of\nemployment, EMPLOYEE shall immediately return to NIKE all Protected\nInformation in whatever form, including tapes, notebooks, drawings, digital files or other media containing\nProtected Information, and all copies thereof, then in EMPLOYEE's possession or under EMPLOYEE's control.\n5. Unauthorized Use. During the period of employment with NIKE and thereafter, EMPLOYEE will notify NIKE\nimmediately if EMPLOYEE becomes aware of the unauthorized possession, use or knowledge of any Protected\nInformation by any person employed or not employed by NIKE at the time of such possession, use or\nknowledge. EMPLOYEE will cooperate with NIKE in the investigation of any such incident and will cooperate\nwith NIKE in any litigation with third parties deemed necessary by NIKE to protect the Protected Information.\nNIKE shall provide reasonable reimbursement to EMPLOYEE for each hour so engaged, and that amount shall\nnot be diminished by operation of any payment under paragraph 1(d) of this Agreement.\n6. Non-Solicitation/Non-Recruitment. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year\nthereafter, EMPLOYEE will not directly or indirectly solicit, divert or hire away (or attempt to solicit, divert or hire\naway) to or for himself or any other company or business organization any NIKE employee, whether or not such\nemployee is a full-time employee or temporary employee and whether or not such employment is pursuant to a\nwritten agreement or is at will or any independent contractor working for NIKE.\n7. Accounting of Profits. EMPLOYEE agrees that, if EMPLOYEE should violate any term of this Agreement,\nNIKE shall be entitled to an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, commissions, remuneration\nor benefits that EMPLOYEE directly or indirectly has realized and/or may realize as a result of or in connection\nwith any such violation (including the return of any additional consideration paid by NIKE pursuant to paragraph\n1(d) above). Such remedy shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or other rights or\nremedies to which NIKE may be entitled at law or in equity.\n8. General Provisions.\n(a) Survival. This Agreement shall continue in effect after the termination of EMPLOYEE's employment,\nregardless of the reason for termination.\n(b) Waiver. No waiver, amendment, modification or cancellation of any term or condition of this Agreement will\nbe effective unless executed in writing by both parties. No written waiver will excuse the performance of any\nact other than the act or acts specifically referred to therein.\n(c) Severability. Each provision herein will be treated as a separate and independent clause, and\nunenforceability of any one clause will in no way impact the enforceability of any other clause. Should any of\nthe provisions in this Agreement be found to be unreasonable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,\nsuch provision will be enforceable to the maximum extent enforceable by the law of that jurisdiction.\n(d) Applicable Law/Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder, shall be\nconstrued according to the laws of the state of Oregon. EMPLOYEE further hereby submits to the jurisdiction\nof, and agrees that exclusive jurisdiction over and venue for, any action or proceeding arising out of or\nrelating to this Agreement shall lie in the state and federal courts located in Oregon.\nNIKE, Inc.\n__________________________\n_____________________________\nSignature\nSignature\n___________________________\n_____________________________\nName\nName\n_________________\n_____________________________\nDate\nTitle\n_____________________________\nDate","{""jurisdiction"": ""Oregon"", ""party"": ""Nike_Inc.""}",1958,1

The receiving party will treat as confidential all Confidential Information made available to the receiving party or to any employee,\nagent or representative of the receiving party.\nb. The receiving party shall protect the Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure by using the same degree of care as\nthe receiving party uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature, but no less than a reasonable degree of care.\nc.

Each party understands that each party is a publicly-held company and that all or part of each party’s Confidential Information may\nconstitute material non-public information under the United States securities laws, and each party acknowledges that it is aware that the United\nStates securities laws prohibit any person who is in the possession of material non-public information about a company from purchasing or\nselling that company’s securities in reliance upon such information or from communicating such information to any other person or entity under\ncircumstances in which it is reasonably foreseeable that such person or entity is likely to purchase or sell such securities in reliance upon such\ninformation.

"effective_date,jurisdiction,party,term","EX-10.9 4 ex10_9.txt NON COMPETE AGREEMENT COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE AND NON-DISCLOSURE\nAGREEMENT PARTIES: Mark G. Parker (EMPLOYEE) NIKE, Inc., an Oregon corporation, and its divisions,\nsubsidiaries and affiliates (NIKE) DATE: October 6, 1994 RECITALS: A. This Covenant Not to Compete is executed\nupon the EMPLOYEE's assumption of additional responsibilities for worldwide marketing and development activities of\nNIKE. B. Over the course of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE, EMPLOYEE will be or has been exposed to and/or\nin a position to generate confidential information including but not limited to confidential techniques, methods, styles,\ndesigns and design concepts, developments, customer lists, vendor lists, contract factory lists, pricing information,\nmanufacturing plans, business plans, marketing plans, sales information, methods of operation, knowledge and data\nrelating to processes, products, machines, compounds and compositions, formulae, lasts and molds. It is anticipated that\nEMPLOYEE will continue to be exposed to confidential information, will be exposed to more confidential information\nand to confidential information of greater sensitivity as EMPLOYEE advances in the company. This confidential\ninformation is information peculiar to NIKE's business. The nature of NIKE's business is highly competitive and\ndisclosure of any confidential information would result in severe damage to NIKE and be difficult to measure. C . NIKE\nmakes use of the confidential information described in paragraph B above throughout the world. This confidential\ninformation of NIKE can be used to NIKE's detriment anywhere in the world. D. The provisions of this Covenant Not to\nCompete and Non-Disclosure Agreement are a condition of EMPLOYEE's employment advancement with NIKE. E.\nThe provisions of this Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement are reasonable. AGREEMENTS: 1.\nCOVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. During the period of time EMPLOYEE is employed by NIKE, under the terms of\nany employment contract or otherwise, and for one (1) year thereafter, EMPLOYEE will not directly or indirectly, own,\nmanage, operate, join, control, or participate in the ownership, management, operation or control of, or be employed by\nor connected in any manner with, any business engaged anywhere in the world in the athletic footwear business, athletic\napparel business, or any other business which directly competes with NIKE or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated\ncorporations. This provision is (a) subject to NIKE's option to waive, but only with the concurrence of the EMPLOYEE,\nall or any portion of the one (1) year time period of non-competition following termination more specifically provided\nfor in paragraph 2; and (b) subject to NIKE's option to specifically identify, at the time of termination, those businesses\nwhich EMPLOYEE may not be employed by or connected with for the period of non-competition. NIKE agrees to act in\ngood faith in its exercise of the above-noted options. 2. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION. a . As additional\nconsideration for the covenant not to compete described in paragraph 1 above, it is agreed that: (i) If EMPLOYEE\nvoluntarily leaves the employ of NIKE at any time during the term hereof, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE an amount per\nmonth equal to one-twenty-fourth (1/24) of EMPLOYEE's then current ""Annual NIKE Income"" (defined herein to mean\nbase salary and bonuses received by EMPLOYEE during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding\ntermination), or $20,833.34 per month, whichever is greater, for the one (1) year period of non- competition following\nvoluntary termination of employment, payable on the first day of each month, or (ii) If EMPLOYEE is involuntarily\nterminated by NIKE at any time during the term hereof, either with or without cause, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE an\namount per month equal to one-twelfth (1/12) of EMPLOYEE's then current Annual NIKE Income, or $41,666.67 per\nmonth, whichever is greater, for the one (1) year period of non-competition following involuntary termination of\nemployment, payable on the first day of each month. b. NIKE may waive all or any portion of the one (1) year period of\nnon-competition following termination, subject to the following provisions: (i) At any time during, or prior to the\ncommencement of, the one (1) year period, NIKE may tender to EMPLOYEE thirty (30) days written notice of its desire\nto waive all or the then remaining portion of the one (1) year period of non-competition. Within the thirty (30) day notice\nperiod, EMPLOYEE will have the option of accepting or rejecting NIKE's tender by advising NIKE in writing of\nEMPLOYEE's election to accept the waiver, in which event EMPLOYEE would be free to compete at the end of the\nthirty (30) day notice period and all payments to EMPLOYEE hereunder would cease, or to reject the waiver, in which\nevent EMPLOYEE would continue to be prohibited from competing for the remaining portion of the one (1) year period\nof non- competition and payments to EMPLOYEE would continue as herein provided. (ii) However, notwithstanding\nanything contained in subparagraph 2(b)(i) above, if EMPLOYEE is terminated by NIKE ""for cause"" (defined herein to\ninclude only continual and repeated neglect of duties and dishonesty) NIKE shall have the unqualified right to waive,\nwithout EMPLOYEE's consent, all or any portion of the one (1) year period of non-competition following termination,\nby giving EMPLOYEE written notice of such election not less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the\nwaiver. In that event, NIKE shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE hereunder for any months as to which the\ncovenant not to compete has been waived. 3. LESSER RESTRICTIONS . Should any of the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2\nabove be found unreasonable or invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the parties agree to accept as binding, in\nlieu thereof, the maximum terms enforceable by law. 4. EXTENSION OF TIME. The covenant not to compete described\nin paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 above shall be extended by a time period equal to any time consumed in enforcement of the\nobligations hereunder during which EMPLOYEE engaged in activities violating the covenant not to compete. 5. NON-\nDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT. During the period of employment by NIKE and forever thereafter, EMPLOYEE will\nhold in confidence all information of a confidential nature, including but not limited to the information described in\nRecital ""B"", (all of which information of a confidential nature shall hereinafter be referred to as ""confidential\ninformation"") and will not, any time, directly or indirectly, use any confidential information for any purpose outside the\nscope of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE or disclose any confidential information to any person or organization\nwithout the prior written consent of NIKE. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, EMPLOYEE shall not ever copy,\ntransmit, reproduce, summarize, quote, publish or make any commercial or other use whatsoever of any confidential\ninformation without the prior written consent of NIKE. 6. RETURN OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Upon\ntermination and upon written request by NIKE at any time, EMPLOYEE shall return to NIKE all documents, records,\nnotebooks and other similar repositories of or containing confidential information, including all copies thereof, then in\nEMPLOYEE's possession, whether prepared by EMPLOYEE or others, and deliver to NIKE any and all other\nconfidential information, in whatever form, that may be in EMPLOYEE's possession or under EMPLOYEE's control. 7.\nUNAUTHORIZED USE. During the period of employment with NIKE and thereafter, EMPLOYEE shall notify NIKE\nimmediately of the unauthorized possession, use or knowledge of any confidential information by any person employed\nor not employed by NIKE at the time of such possession, use or knowledge. EMPLOYEE shall promptly furnish details\nof such possession, use or knowledge to NIKE, will assist in preventing the reoccurrence of such possession, use or\nknowledge, and shall cooperate with NIKE in any litigation against third parties deemed necessary by NIKE to protect\nthe confidential information. EMPLOYEE's compliance with this paragraph shall not be construed in any way as a\nwaiver of any of NIKE's rights or remedies against EMPLOYEE arising out of or related to such unauthorized\npossession, use or knowledge. 8. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. The remedy at law for any breach of this Covenant Not to\nCompete and Non-Disclosure Agreement will be inadequate. It is reasonable to require that EMPLOYEE not compete\nwith NIKE in order to protect NIKE from unfair use of the confidential information. NIKE shall be entitled to injunctive\nrelief in addition to any other remedy it may have. A breach of this Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure\nAgreement during the period of EMPLOYEE's employment in addition to any other rights or remedies NIKE may have.\n9. WAIVER, AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION OR CANCELLATION. No waiver, amendment, modification or\ncancellation of any term or condition of this Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement shall be effective\nunless executed in writing by the party charged therewith. No written waiver shall excuse the performance of any act\nother than the act or acts specifically referred to therein. 10. APPLICABLE LAW/JURISDICTION/VENUE. This\nCovenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement, and EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder, shall be\nconstrued according to the laws of the state of Oregon and EMPLOYEE hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the courts\nof the state of Oregon and waives application of any foreign law relating to this Agreement and EMPLOYEE's\nemployment by NIKE. Any suit or action of any kind relating to this Agreement or the subject matter hereof shall be\nbrought in a court located in Washington County, Oregon. EMPLOYEE NIKE, Inc. By: /s/ Mark G.

Purpose. Blackbaud and Company wish to explore a business possibility (the “Proposed Transaction”) under which each may disclose, by\nthemselves or through their respective representatives, attorneys or agents, its Confidential Information to the other.\nDefinition. “Confidential Information” means any information, technical data, or know-how, including, but not limited to, that which relates to\nresearch, product plans, products, services, customers, markets, software, developments, inventions, processes, designs, drawings, engineering,\nhardware configuration information, marketing or finances, the identity of the parties, financial and business plans, strategies and projections, or that\nis of such a nature that would reasonably be construed as confidential or proprietary which Confidential Information is designated in writing to be\nconfidential or proprietary, or if given orally, is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or confirmed promptly in writing as having been\ndisclosed as confidential or proprietary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include: (i) information that at the time of\ndisclosure is generally available to the public or is otherwise available to the receiving party other than on a confidential basis; (ii) information that,\nafter disclosure, becomes generally available to the public by publication or otherwise through no fault of the receiving party; (iii) information\ndisclosed to the receiving party by a third party not under an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; or (iv) information that can be\nclearly demonstrated to be developed by an employee, agent or contractor of the party independently of the disclosures by the disclosing party. In the\nevent that a party or its representative is required by applicable law, regulation or legal process to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such\nparty will notify the other party promptly so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy, consult with such party\nregarding taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of the required disclosure or, in the other party’s sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms\nof this Confidentiality Agreement. Such party and its representatives will cooperate fully with the other party and its representatives in any attempt\nby such party to obtain any such protective order or other remedy. In the event that no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or that the\nother party waives compliance with the terms of this Agreement, such party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is\nadvised by counsel is legally required and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be\naccorded to the Confidential Information disclosed.\n2. Nondisclosure of Confidential Information. Blackbaud and Company agree, and agree to use its best efforts to cause any employee or\nthird party with access to Confidential Information, not to use the Confidential Information disclosed to it by the other party for its own use or for\nany purpose except to carry out discussions concerning and the undertaking of any business relationship between the two.

Each agrees that it will take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of and avoid\ndisclosure or use of Confidential Information of the other in order to prevent it from falling into the public domain or the possession of persons other\nthan those persons authorized hereunder to have any such information, which measures shall include the highest degree of care that the receiving\nparty utilizes to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. Each party agrees to notify the other in writing of any misuse or\nmisappropriation of Confidential Information of the other that may come to its attention. Each party understands that, except as otherwise agreed in\nwriting, the Confidential Information which it may receive concerning the other party’s future plans with respect to the business possibility is\ntentative and is not intended to represent firm decisions by the other party concerning the implementation of such plans.\nPage1of3\nMUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT\nConfidential Information provided hereunder, by one party to the other, does not represent or imply any commitment beyond the express terms of\nthis Agreement.\n3. Return of Materials.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and for the benefit of the undersigned parties, their successors and assigns, provided\nthat Confidential Information may not be assigned without the prior written consent of the disclosing party. Failure to enforce any provision of this\nAgreement shall not constitute a waiver of any term hereof. In the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held by a court or other\ntribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions hereof shall remain in full force and effect and such\nprovision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or\ninvalidated. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement\nand all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.

Actuate and Company intend to discuss a potential business relationship.\nEach undersigned party (the “Receiving Party”) and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, or advisors (including, without\nlimitation, legal advisors, accountants, consultants, bankers, and financial advisors) and potential sources of financing (collectively,\n“Representatives”) understands that during these discussions the other party (the “Disclosing Party’’) may disclose Proprietary Information (as\ndefined herein) relating to the Disclosing Party’s business.\nIn consideration of the parties’ discussions and any access the Receiving Party may have to Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party, the\nReceiving Party hereby agrees as follows:\n1. As used herein, the term “Proprietary Information” refers to any and all Information of a confidential, proprietary, or secret nature which\nis applicable to or related In any way to (i) the business, present or future, of the Disclosing Party, (ii) the research and development or\ninvestigations of the Disclosing Party or (iii) the business of any customer of the Disclosing Party; provided, in each case, that such information\nis delivered to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party and (a) is marked or identified in writing as “Confidential”, (b) if verbal or visual\ndisclosure, is identified as “Confidential” in a writing within ten (10) business days of such disclosure, or (c) is information that the Receiving\nParty actually knew or reasonably should have known was confidential. Proprietary Information may include, for example and without\nlimitation, the product offering, content partners, product pricing, product availability, computer programs, technical drawings, algorithms,\nprocesses, ideas, schematics, trade secrets, processes, formulas, data, know-how, improvements, inventions (whether patentable or not),\ntechniques, marketing plans, forecasts and strategies, and information concerning customers or vendors. Proprietary Information shall also\ninclude all information of a like nature owned by any other person and furnished to the Disclosing Party by such other person pursuant to an\nundertaking by the Disclosing Party to maintain the same in confidence.\n2. The Receiving Party agrees (a) to hold the Disclosing Party’s Proprietary Information In strict confidence and to take all reasonable\nprecautions to protect such Proprietary Information (including, without limitation, all precautions that Receiving Party employs with respect to\nits confidential materials), (b) not to divulge any such Proprietary Information or any information derived therefrom to any third person without\nprior written permission of the Disclosing Party, excluding disclosure to Representatives, (c) not to make any use whatsoever at any time of such\nProprietary Information except to evaluate internally whether to enter into the contemplated business relationship with the Disclosing Party, and\n(d) not to copy or reverse engineer any such Proprietary Information. Any employee given access to any such Proprietary Information must have\na legitimate “need to know” and be subject to restrictions on disclosure of Proprietary Information practically identical to the terms set forth\nherein. Without granting any right or license, the Disclosing Party agrees that the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c) shall not apply with respect to\nany information that (i) is or (through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving Party or any agent, consultant or employee) becomes\ngenerally available to the public, or (ii) was or is rightfully in Receiving Party’s possession or the possession of any of its Representatives or was\nknown by it or its Representatives without restriction prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (iii) was or is rightfully disclosed to Receiving\nParty or any of its Representatives by a third party provided the Receiving Party complies with restrictions imposed by the third party, or (iv) was\nor is independently developed without\nuse of any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party and its Representatives may make disclosures required by court\norder or any legal or judicial process, without any liability hereunder, provided the Receiving Party uses reasonable efforts to limit disclosure and\nto obtain confidential treatment or a protective order and has allowed the Disclosing Party to participate In the proceeding to the extent legally\npermissible and reasonably practicable.\n3. Promptly upon receipt of a written request by the Disclosing Party at any time (which will be effective if actually received or three days\nafter mailed first class postage prepaid to the Receiving Party’s address herein), the Receiving Party will turn over to the Disclosing Party, or, at\nits sole discretion, destroy and certify to the Receiving party in writing the destruction of all Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party and\nall documents or media containing any such Proprietary Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof; provided, however, the Company\nand its Representatives shall not be obligated to return or destroy Proprietary Information to the extent otherwise required by law, regulation, rule\nor practice governing professionals or any internal compliance policy or procedure required by law, regulation rule of practice governing\nprofessionals.

Except to the extent required by law, neither party shall disclose the existence or subject matter of the negotiations or business\nrelationship contemplated by this Agreement.\n5. The parties acknowledge and agree that due to the unique nature of the possible transaction between the parties, there can be no adequate\nremedy at law for any material breach of this Agreement, that any such breach may allow the breaching party or third parties to unfairly compete\nwith the non-breaching party, resulting in irreparable harm to the non-breaching party, and therefore, that upon any such breach or any threat\nthereof, the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever remedies it might have at law. The\nReceiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party In writing immediately upon the occurrence of any unauthorized release or other breach of\nwhich it is aware.\n6. The parties expressly agree that neither the terms or conditions of this Agreement, nor the discussions held by the parties to address the\nfeasibility of a potential business relationship shall be construed as to prevent either party from pursuing similar discussions with third parties in\nsimilar markets or obligate either party to take, continue or forgo any action relating to the above-mentioned discussions. Further, nothing in this\nAgreement shall be construed as prohibiting or restricting either party from independently developing, acquiring, and marketing products,\nservices, and other materials, which are similar to or competitive In any geographic area and in any form with the other party’s product(s) or\nservice(s).

Henderson (“Executive”) and Cardinal Health, Inc., an Ohio Corporation (the “Company”) effective as of June\n10, 2014.\nIt is hereby agreed as follows:\n1.\nConsideration and Acknowledgements. The parties acknowledge that the provisions and covenants\ncontained in this Agreement are ancillary and material to, and in consideration of, the letter agreement concerning\nExecutive’s retirement dated June 10, 2014 (the “Letter Agreement”) and that the limitations contained herein are\nreasonable in geographic and temporal scope and do not impose a greater restriction or restraint than is necessary to\nprotect the goodwill and other legitimate business interests of the Company.\n2.\nConfidential Information. The Executive shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the Company\nand all of its subsidiaries, partnerships, joint ventures, limited liability companies, and other affiliates (collectively, the\n""Cardinal Group""), all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to the Cardinal Group and its\nbusinesses (including, without limitation, any proprietary and not publicly available information concerning any\nprocesses, methods, trade secrets, research, secret data, costs, names of users or purchasers of their respective\nproducts or services, business methods, operating procedures or programs or methods of promotion and sale) that\nExecutive has obtained or obtains during the Executive's employment by the Cardinal Group and that is not public\nknowledge (other than as a result of the Executive's violation of this Agreement) (""Confidential Information""). For the\npurposes of this Agreement, information shall not be deemed to be publicly available merely because it is embraced by\ngeneral disclosures or because individual features or combinations thereof are publicly available. Executive shall not\ncommunicate, divulge or disseminate Confidential Information at any time during or after Executive's employment with\nthe Cardinal Group, except with prior written consent of the applicable Cardinal Group company, or as otherwise\nrequired by law or legal process. All records, files, memoranda, reports, customer lists, drawings, plans, documents and\nthe like that Executive uses, prepares or comes into contact with during the course of Executive's employment shall\nremain the sole property of the Company and/or the Cardinal Group, as applicable, and shall be turned over to the\napplicable Cardinal Group company upon termination of Executive's employment.\n3.\nNon-Recruitment of Cardinal Group Employees, etc. Executive shall not, at any time during the\nRestricted Period (as defined in this Agreement), without the prior written consent of the Company, engage in the\nfollowing conduct (a ""Solicitation""): (i) directly or indirectly, solicit, recruit or employ (whether as an employee, officer,\ndirector, agent, consultant or independent contractor) any person who is or was at any time during the previous twelve\nmonths an employee, representative, officer or director of the Cardinal Group; or (ii) take any action to encourage or\ninduce any employee, representative, officer or director of the Cardinal Group to cease his or her relationship with the\nCardinal Group for any reason. A ""Solicitation"" does not include any recruitment of employees for the Cardinal Group.\nThe ""Restricted Period"" means the period from the date of this Agreement\nuntil twenty-four months after Executive’s retirement date of August 21, 2015 specified in the Letter Agreement.\n4.\nNo Competition -- Solicitation of Business. During the Restricted Period, Executive shall not (as an\nofficer, agent, employee, partner, consultant or director of any other company, partnership or entity) be personally\ninvolved in direct or indirect solicitation on behalf of any competitor of the Cardinal Group of the business of (i) any\ncustomer of the Cardinal Group during the time of Executive's employment or at date of termination of employment or\n(ii) any potential customer of the Cardinal Group which Executive knew to be an identified, prospective purchaser of\nservices or products of the Cardinal Group.\n5.\nNo Competition -- Employment by Competitor. During the Restricted Period, Executive shall not invest\nin (other than in a publicly traded company with a maximum investment of no more than 1% of outstanding shares),\ncounsel, advise, or be otherwise engaged or employed by, any of the primary competitors of the Cardinal Group.\n6.\nAcknowledgement and Enforcement. Executive acknowledges and agrees that: (A) the purpose of the\nforegoing covenants, including without limitation the noncompetition covenants of Sections 4 and 5, is to protect the\ngoodwill, trade secrets and other Confidential Information of the Company; (B) because of the nature of the business in\nwhich the Cardinal Group is engaged and because of the nature of the Confidential Information to which Executive has\naccess, the Company would suffer irreparable harm and it would be impractical and excessively difficult to determine\nthe actual damages of the Cardinal Group in the event Executive breached any of the covenants of this Agreement; and\n(C) remedies at law (such as monetary damages) for any breach of Executive's obligations under this Agreement would\nbe inadequate. Executive therefore agrees and consents that if Executive commits any breach of a covenant under this\nAgreement or threatens to commit any such breach, the Company shall have the right (in addition to, and not in lieu of,\nany other right or remedy that may be available to it) to temporary and permanent injunctive relief from a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction, without posting any bond or other security and without the necessity of proof of actual damage.\n7.\nMiscellaneous.\n(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of\nOhio, without reference to principles of conflict of laws. If, under any such law, any portion of this Agreement is at any\ntime deemed to be in conflict with any applicable statute, rule, regulation or ordinance, such portion shall be deemed to\nbe modified or altered to conform thereto. The parties hereto irrevocably agree to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of\nthe courts of the State of Ohio in any action or proceeding brought with respect to or in connection with this Agreement.\nThe captions of this Agreement are not part of the provisions hereof and shall have no force or effect. This Agreement\nmay not be amended or modified otherwise than by a written agreement executed by the parties hereto or their\nrespective successors and legal representatives.\n(b) All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be given by\nhand delivery to the other party or by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, addressed\nas follows:\nIf to the Executive: At the most recent address on file for Executive at the Company.\nIf to the Company: Cardinal Health, Inc.\n7000 Cardinal Place\nDublin, Ohio 43017\nAttention: General Counsel\nor to such other address as either party shall have furnished to the other in writing in accordance herewith.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or\nunenforceable in part, the remaining portion of such provision, together with all other provisions of this Agreement, shall\nremain valid and enforceable and continue in full force and effect to the fullest extent consistent with the law.\n(d) Executive's or the Company's failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this\nAgreement or the failure to assert any right Executive or the Company may have hereunder, shall not be deemed to be\na waiver of such provision or right or any other provision or right of this Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, Executive has hereunto set Executive's hand and the Company has caused these presents\nto be executed in its name and on its behalf, all as of the day and year first above written.\n_/s/ Jeffrey W.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party shall not disclose any computer source code that contains\nConfidential Information of the Disclosing Party in accordance with a judicial or other governmental order unless it complies with the requirement\nset forth in sub-section (i) of this Section 2(b).\n(c) The undersigned Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to Receiving Party’s employees and consultants on a need-to-\nknow basis. The Receiving Party will have executed or shall execute appropriate written agreements with its employees and consultants sufficient to\nenable Receiving Party to enforce all the provisions of this Agreement.\n(d) Receiving Party shall notify the undersigned Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of\nConfidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party and its employees and consultants, and will cooperate with\nDisclosing Party in every reasonable way to help Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further\nunauthorized use or disclosure.\n(e) Receiving Party shall, at Disclosing Party’s request, return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Confidential Information\nand all other tangible materials and devices provided to the Receiving Party as Confidential Information, or at Disclosing Party’s option, certify\ndestruction of the same.\n3.

Miscellaneous\n(a) All Confidential Information is and shall remain the property of Disclosing Party.

Unless otherwise agreed by the Disclosing Party and the Receiving\nParty, all such computer software and/or hardware is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind, and Receiving Party agrees that neither\nDisclosing Party nor its suppliers shall be liable for any damages whatsoever arising from or relating to Receiving Party’s use of or inability to use\nsuch software and/or hardware.\n(c) The parties agree to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to (i) any Confidential Information, or (ii) any\nproduct (or any part thereof), process or service that is the direct product of the Confidential Information, including the U.S. Export Administration\nRegulations, as well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments.

No waiver of any provision of this\nAgreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.\n(f) If either Disclosing Party or the Receiving Party employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the\nprevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.

Process may be served on either\nparty in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.\n(g) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party’s respective successors and lawful assigns; provided, however,\nthat neither party may assign this Agreement (whether by operation of law, sale of securities or assets, merger or otherwise), in whole or in part,\nwithout the prior written approval of the other party.

Both parties agree that all Feedback is and shall be given entirely\nvoluntarily. Feedback, even if designated as confidential by the party offering the Feedback, shall not, absent a separate written agreement, create\nany confidentiality obligation for the receiver of the Feedback. Receiving Party will not give Feedback that is subject to license terms that seek to\nrequire any Disclosing Party product, technology, service or documentation incorporating or derived from such Feedback, or any Disclosing Party\nintellectual property, to be licensed or otherwise shared with any third party. Furthermore, except as otherwise provided herein or in a separate\nsubsequent written agreement between the parties, the receiver of the Feedback shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license or otherwise\ndistribute, and exploit the Feedback provided to it as it sees fit, entirely without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of intellectual\nproperty rights or otherwise.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement.\nCOMPANY: ELECTRONIC ARTS INC.\nMICROSOFT CORPORATION\nAddress: 209 Redwood Shores Parkway\nRedwood City, CA 94065\nOne Microsoft Way\nRedmond, WA 98052-6399\nSign: /s/ M.

In the event of any controversy in interpretation of either\nagreement, the language in the employment agreement shall supersede any language in this agreement.\nIn consideration of the Company employing Employee and the compensation to be paid to Employee during the course of his/her\nemployment, Employee hereby agrees as follows:\n1. Effective Date-Affiliates.\n(a) This Agreement shall be effective as of the first day of employment with the Company.\n(b) All references to Affiliates shall include American Gaming Systems, AGS Partners LLC , AGS Capital, LLC, AGS\nHoldings, LLC, GTNA Solutions, Corporation or any other entity acquired or organized by the Company during the course of the Employee’s\nemployment with the Company.\n2. Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Covenant Not to Compete.\n(a) Non-Disclosure. Employee understands and acknowledges that Confidential Information (as defined herein), constitutes a\nvaluable asset of Company and its Affiliates, and may not be converted to Employee’s own use. During the course of employment and thereafter,\nEmployee shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to\nCompany or its Affiliates, and their respective businesses, that shall not be public knowledge (other than information which becomes public as a\nresult of acts of Employee or his representatives in violation of this Agreement), including, without limitation, its products, programs, projects,\npromotions, marketing, business plans or practices, business operations, employees, research and development, intellectual property,\ncustomer/client information, matters subject to litigation, and technology or financial information of Company or its Affiliates (collectively\nreferred to as “Confidential Information”), without the prior written consent of Company. In the event Employee is required by law or court\norder to disclose any Confidential Information, Employee shall promptly notify Company of such requirement and provide Company with a copy\nof any court order or of any law that requires such disclosure and, if Company so elects, to the extent permitted by law, provide Company an\nadequate opportunity, at its own expense, to contest such law or court order, prior to any such required disclosure by Employee.\n-1-\n(b) Non-Solicitation.\n(1) Employees. During the course of employment and for a two (2) year period thereafter, Employee shall not, for\nhimself or any third party, alone or as a member of a partnership or limited liability company, or as an officer, director, shareholder or otherwise,\ndirectly or indirectly, solicit or contact any employee of Company or any Affiliate of Company, with a view to inducing or encouraging such\nemployee to leave the employ of Company or its Affiliates, for the purpose of being employed at a company employing Employee, a employer\naffiliated with Company or any competitor of Company or any affiliate thereof.\n(2) Client and Customers. Employee agrees that for a period of one (1) year after the termination of employment with\nthe Company for any reason whatsoever, Employee shall not, on behalf of Employee or on behalf of any other individual, association or entity,\ncall on any of the clients or customers of the Company or any affiliate of the Company for the purpose of soliciting or inducing any of such\ncustomers to acquire (or providing to any of such customers) any product or service provided by the Company or an affiliate of the Company, nor\nwill Employee in any way, directly or indirectly, as agent or otherwise, in any other manner solicit, influence or encourage such customers to take\naway or to divert or direct their business to Employee or any other person or entity by or with which Employee is employed, associated, affiliated\nor otherwise related.\n(c) Covenant Not to Compete. As a material inducement for Company to enter into this Agreement, during the course of\nemployment and during a one (1) year period thereafter, Employee shall not directly or indirectly, engage or participate in any way in nor accept\nany such position or affiliation with, nor render any such services on behalf of, any Competing Business, notwithstanding the job title given to\nEmployee by any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement a Competing Business shall mean any person or business engaged in the\nmanufacturing and/or distribution of Class II and/or Class III electronic gaming devices and/or casino back office systems. If you are terminated\nwithout “Cause” as defined in your offer letter the Covenant Not to Compete portion of this Agreement shall terminate after six (6) months\nunless the Company continues to pay your base salary (per the normal Company payroll cycle) for six (6) months past the date of termination in\nexchange for an additional six (6) month extension of the Covenant Not to Compete.\n(d) Acknowledgement. The parties acknowledge that Company would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of\nthe preceding reasonable restrictions in this Section 2, and Employee confirms that these restrictions do not and will not unduly impair his ability\nto make a living after the termination of his/her employment with Company, the purpose of which is to protect the goodwill and other legitimate\nbusiness interests of Company. Employee acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 2 are reasonable and necessary for the\n-2-\nprotection of Company and that Company will be irrevocably damaged if such provisions are not specifically enforced. Accordingly, Employee\nagrees that, in addition to any other relief to which Company may be entitled in the form of actual or punitive damages, Company shall be\nentitled to seek and obtain injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction (without posting a bond therefore) for the purpose of\nrestraining Employee from any actual or threatened breach of such provisions. The provisions of this Section 2 shall survive the term of\nemployment.\n3. Prior Commitments. Employee has no other agreements, relationships, or commitments to any other person or entity that conflict\nwith Employee’s obligations to the Company under this Agreement.\n4. Proprietary Information or Trade Secrets of Others. Employee will not disclose to the Company or its Affiliates, or use, or induce\nthe Company to use, any proprietary information or trade secrets of others. Employee represents and warrants that he/she has returned all\nproperty and Confidential Information belonging to all prior employers.\n5. Delivery of Documents and Data Upon Termination. In the event of termination of Employee’s employment with the Company for\nany reason whatsoever, Employee agrees, promptly and without request, to deliver to and inform the Company of all documents and data\npertaining to his/her employment, and the Confidential Information of the Company, whether prepared by Employee or otherwise coming into\nhis/her possession or control. Employee will not retain any written or other tangible material, or copies thereof, containing any information\nconcerning or disclosing any of the Confidential Information of the Company. Employee recognizes that such unauthorized taking of the\nCompany’s trade secrets can result in criminal penalties and civil liability under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act; and that willful misappropriation\nmay result in fines and an award against Employee for damages as well as the Company’s attorneys’ fees in collecting such damages, which shall\nbe in addition to, and shall not supersede, the Company’s available remedies pursuant to state and federal law.\n6. Equitable Remedies. Employee recognizes and agrees that the violation, breach or threatened violation or breach of any term,\nprovision, or condition of this Agreement may cause irreparable damage to the Company which is difficult to calculate, and that the award of any\nsum or damages may not be adequate relief to the Company. Employee therefore agrees that, in addition to all of the remedies available in the\nevent of any actual or threatened violation or breach of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to injunctive and other equitable relief.\nHowever, no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable remedy shall be construed as a waiver of or prohibition against the\npursuit of other legal or equitable remedies in the event of the actual or threatened violation or breach of a provision of this Agreement.\n7. Cumulative Remedies. Each and all of the several rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be cumulative. No one\nright or remedy shall be exclusive of the others, or of any right or remedy allowed in law or in equity. No waiver or indulgence by the Company\nof any failure by Employee to keep or perform any promise or condition of this\n-3-\nAgreement shall be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding breach of the same, or any other promise or condition. No waiver by the Company\nof any right shall be construed as a waiver of any other right. The Company shall not be required to give notice to enforce strict adherence to all\nterms of this Agreement.\n8. Attorneys’ Fees. If any action is necessary to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’\nfees, costs, and expenses.\n9. Material Condition of Employment. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the protections set forth in this Agreement are a\nmaterial condition to his/her employment with and compensation by the Company.\n10. Amendment and Binding Effect. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by both parties.\nThis Agreement shall be binding on the heirs, executors, administrators, and other legal representatives and assigns of Employee, and is for the\nbenefit of the Company and its successors and assigns.\n11. Governing Law. The laws of the State of Nevada (without giving effect to choice of law or conflict of law principles) shall govern\nthe validity, construction, performance and effect of this Agreement, except to the extent governed by federal law, irrespective of the fact that one\nor more of the parities now is, or may become, a resident or citizen of a different state or country. The parties hereby expressly submit to the\npersonal jurisdiction of the court or arbitral forum located in Clark County, State of Nevada, and waive any objection or defense based on\npersonal jurisdiction or venue that might otherwise be asserted to proceeding in such forum(s).\n12.

No other rights, and particularly licenses, to trademarks, inventions, copyrights, patents, mask work rights, or\nany other intellectual property rights are implied or granted under this Agreement or by the delivery of Confidential Information by one Party to\nthe other Party.\n3.\nCopying.\nConfidential Information supplied by one Party shall not be reproduced by the other Party in any\nform except to the extent reasonably necessary to enable such other Party to evaluate the Transaction.\n4.\nCare. The Receiving Party shall treat Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as proprietary and\nconfidential and shall use the same degree of care to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as\nthe Receiving Party provides to protect its own Confidential Information but no less than reasonable care. The Receiving Party shall maintain the\nConfidential Information received from the Disclosing Party in confidence and shall retain such Confidential Information in a secure place. The\nReceiving Party shall disclose and permit access to such Confidential Information only to those of its Representatives who reasonably need to\nknow such information in order to evaluate the Transaction and with whom the Receiving Party has established practices or procedures to\nmaintain the confidence of such Confidential Information and who are informed of the confidential and proprietary nature of such information\nand the provisions of this Agreement.

All notices and communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to be duly given if delivered in accordance\nwith Section 10(g) of the Purchase Agreement.\n(12) Modification.

Confidential Information may be disclosed in written or other tangible form\n(including on magnetic media) or by oral, visual or other means. The term “Affiliate” means any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling,\ncontrolled by, or under common control with a Party.\n2. A Recipient of Confidential Information may use the Confidential Information only for the purpose of [a possible business\nrelationship or transaction]\nand only during the period of time stated in the first sentence of Section 10.\n3. Recipient shall protect such Confidential Information from disclosure to others, using the same degree of care used to protect its own\nconfidential or proprietary information of like importance, but in any case using no less than a reasonable degree of care. Recipient may disclose\nConfidential Information received hereunder to (i) its Affiliates who agree, in advance, in writing, to be bound by this Agreement, and (ii) to its\nemployees and independent contractors, and its Affiliates’ employees and independent contractors, who have a need to know, for the purpose of this\nAgreement, and who are bound to protect the received Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure under the terms of a written\nagreement. Confidential Information shall not otherwise be disclosed to any third party without the prior written consent of the Owner.\n4. The restrictions of this Agreement on use and disclosure of Confidential Information shall not apply to information that:\n(a) Was publicly known at the time of Owner’s communication thereof to Recipient;\n(b) Becomes publicly known through no fault of Recipient subsequent to the time of Owner’s communication thereof to Recipient;\n(c) Was in Recipient’s possession free of any obligation of confidence at the time of Owner’s communication thereof to Recipient;\n(d) Is developed by Recipient independently of and without reference to any of Owner’s Confidential Information or other information that\nOwner disclosed in confidence to any third party;\n(e) Is rightfully obtained by Recipient from third parties authorized to make such disclosure without restriction; or\n(f) Is identified in writing by Owner as no longer proprietary or confidential.\n5. In the event Recipient is required by law, regulation or court order to disclose any of Owner’s Confidential Information, Recipient will\npromptly notify Owner in writing prior to making any such disclosure in order to facilitate Owner seeking a protective order or other appropriate\nremedy from the proper authority. Recipient agrees to cooperate with Owner in seeking such order or other remedy. Recipient further agrees that if\nOwner is not successful in precluding the requesting legal body from requiring the disclosure of the Confidential Information, it will furnish only\nthat portion of the Confidential Information, which is legally required and will exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that\nconfidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.\n6. All Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement (including information in computer software or held in electronic storage\nmedia) shall be and remain the property of Owner. All such information in tangible form shall be returned to Owner promptly upon written request\nor the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and shall not thereafter be retained in any form by Recipient, its Affiliates, or any employees or\nindependent contractors of Recipient or its Affiliates.\n7. If a Party generates an internal work product containing the other’s Confidential Information, all tangible forms of that work product\nshall be handled in the same manner, and shall be fully governed by, the terms of this Agreement, as the original version of such Confidential\nInformation. The term “internal work product” includes any hard copy, printout, electronic transfer or other transfer of all or portions of Confidential\nInformation into any medium or discernable form.\n-1-\n8. No licenses or rights under any patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret are granted or are to be implied by this Agreement.\nNeither Party is obligated under this Agreement to purchase from or provide to the other Party any service or product.\n9. Owner shall not have any liability or responsibility for errors or omissions in, or any decisions made by Recipient in reliance on, any\nConfidential Information disclosed under this Agreement.\n10. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date first written above and shall automatically expire two (2) years after the later of\n(i) the execution hereof; provided, however, that prior to such expiration, either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time by written notice to\nthe other; and (ii) the expiration of any contract or agreement between the parties for the provision of services and/or products. Notwithstanding such\nexpiration or termination, all of Recipient’s nondisclosure obligations pursuant to this Agreement shall survive with respect to any Confidential\nInformation received prior to such expiration or termination.\n11. Except upon mutual written agreement, or as may be required by law, neither Party shall in any way or in any form disclose the\nexistence or terms of this Agreement, the discussions that gave rise to this Agreement or the fact that there have been, or will be, discussions or\nnegotiations covered by this Agreement.\n12. The Parties acknowledge that Confidential Information is unique and valuable, and that disclosure in breach of this Agreement will\nresult in irreparable injury to Owner for which monetary damages alone would not be an adequate remedy. Therefore, the Parties agree that in the\nevent of a breach or threatened breach of confidentiality, the Owner shall be entitled to specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief\nas a remedy for any such breach or anticipated breach without the necessity of posting a bond. Any such relief shall be in addition to and not in lieu\nof any appropriate relief in the way of monetary damages.\n13. Neither Party shall assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder, except to an Affiliate or successor in interest, without the prior,\nwritten consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.\n14. No failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or\npartial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder.\n15. This Agreement: (a) is the complete agreement of the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior such\nagreements with respect to further disclosures concerning such subject matter; (b) may not be amended or in any manner modified except by a\nwritten instrument signed by authorized representatives of both Parties; and (c) shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of New\nJersey without regard to its choice of law provisions. The parties hereby agree that any dispute arising from the provisions of this or any other\nagreement between the parties may be litigated in the courts of the State of New Jersey or of the United States District Court for the District of New\nJersey and the parties accordingly hereby consent to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts and expressly waive any objections or defenses based\nupon lack of personal jurisdiction or venue. Such reimbursement shall include all such expenses incurred prior to and at any such trial or proceeding\nand at all levels of appeal and post judgment proceedings.\n16. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall be enforced as fully as possible and the\nunenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the limited extent required to permit its enforcement in a manner most closely representing the\nintention of the Parties as expressed herein.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties hereto has caused this Agreement to be executed by its duly authorized representative.\nVITAMIN SHOPPE INDUSTRIES INC.\nPARTY: RENAISSANCE BRANDS LTD.\nBy:\n/s/ Thomas Tolworthy\nBy:\n/s/ Douglas B.

Employee and the compensation to be paid to Employee during the course of his/her\nemployment, Employee hereby agrees as follows:\n1. Effective Date-Affiliates.\n(a) This Agreement shall be effective as of the first day of employment with the Company.\n(b) All references to Affiliates shall include American Gaming Systems, AGS Partners LLC, AGS Capital, LLC, AGS\nHoldings, LLC, GTNA Solutions, Corporation or any other entity acquired or organized by the Company during the course of the Employee’s\nemployment with the Company.\n2. Non-Disclosure, Non-Solicitation and Covenant Not to Compete.\n(a) Non-Disclosure. Employee understands and acknowledges that Confidential Information (as defined herein), constitutes a\nvaluable asset of Company and its Affiliates, and may not be converted to Employee’s own use. During the course of employment and thereafter,\nEmployee shall hold in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of Company all secret or confidential information, knowledge or data relating to\nCompany or its Affiliates, and their respective businesses, that shall not be public knowledge (other than information which becomes public as a\nresult of acts of Employee or his representatives in violation of this Agreement), including, without limitation, its products, programs, projects,\npromotions, marketing, business plans or practices, business operations, employees, research and development, intellectual property,\ncustomer/client information, matters subject to litigation, and technology or financial information of Company or its Affiliates (collectively\nreferred to as “Confidential Information”), without the prior written consent of Company. In the event Employee is required by law or court order\nto disclose any Confidential Information, Employee shall promptly notify Company of such requirement and provide Company with a copy of\nany court order or of any law that requires such disclosure and, if Company so elects, to the extent permitted by law, provide Company an\nadequate opportunity, at its own expense, to contest such law or court order, prior to any such required disclosure by Employee.\n-1-\n(b) Non-Solicitation—Employees. During the course of employment and for a two (2) year period thereafter, Employee shall\nnot, for himself or any third party, alone or as a member of a partnership or limited liability company, or as an officer, director, shareholder or\notherwise, directly or indirectly, solicit or contact any employee of Company or any Affiliate of Company, with a view to inducing or\nencouraging such employee to leave the employ of Company or its Affiliates, for the purpose of being employed at a company employing\nEmployee, a employer affiliated with Company or any competitor of Company or any affiliate thereof.\n(c) Covenant Not to Compete. As a material inducement for Company to enter into this Agreement, during the course of\nemployment and during a one (1) year period thereafter, Employee shall not directly or indirectly engage or participate in any way in nor accept\nany such position or affiliation with, nor render any such services on behalf of, any Competing Business, notwithstanding the job title given to\nEmployee by any Competing Business. For purposes of this Agreement a Competing Business shall mean any person or business engaged in the\nmanufacturing and/or distribution of Class II and/or Class III electronic gaming devices and/or casino back office systems. During this period\nEmployee shall not, on behalf of Employee or on behalf of any other individual, association or entity, call on any of the clients or customers of\nthe Company or any affiliate of the Company for the purpose of soliciting or inducing any of such customers to acquire (or providing to any of\nsuch customers) any product or service provided by the Company or an affiliate of the Company, nor will Employee in any way, directly or\nindirectly, as agent or otherwise, in any other manner solicit, influence or encourage such customers to take away or to divert or direct their\nbusiness to Employee or any other person or entity by or with which Employee is employed, associated, affiliated or otherwise related. If you are\nterminated without “Cause” as defined in your offer letter the Covenant Not to Compete portion of this Agreement shall terminate after six\n(6) months unless the Company continues to pay your base salary (per the normal Company payroll cycle) for six (6) months past the date of\ntermination in exchange for an additional six (6) month extension of the Covenant Not to Compete.\n(d) Acknowledgement. The parties acknowledge that Company would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of\nthe preceding reasonable restrictions in this Section 2, and Employee confirms that these restrictions do not and will not unduly impair his ability\nto make a living after the termination of his/her employment with Company, the purpose of which is to protect the goodwill and other legitimate\nbusiness interests of Company. Employee acknowledges that the provisions of this Section 2 are reasonable and necessary for the protection of\nCompany and that Company will be irrevocably damaged if such provisions are not specifically enforced. Accordingly, Employee agrees that, in\naddition to any other relief to which Company may be entitled in the form of actual or punitive damages, Company shall be entitled to seek and\nobtain injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction (without posting a bond therefore) for the purpose of restraining Employee from\nany actual or threatened breach of such provisions. The provisions of this Section 2 shall survive the term of employment.\n-2-\n3. Prior Commitments. Employee has no other agreements, relationships, or commitments to any other person or entity that conflict\nwith Employee’s obligations to the Company under this Agreement.\n4. Proprietary Information or Trade Secrets of Others. Employee will not disclose to the Company or its Affiliates, or use, or induce\nthe Company to use, any proprietary information or trade secrets of others. Employee represents and warrants that he/she has returned all\nproperty and Confidential Information belonging to all prior employers.\n5. Delivery of Documents and Data Upon Termination. In the event of termination of Employee’s employment with the Company for\nany reason whatsoever, Employee agrees, promptly and without request, to deliver, to and inform the Company of all documents and data\npertaining to his/her employment, and the Confidential Information of the Company, whether prepared by Employee or otherwise coming into\nhis/her possession or control. Employee will not retain any written or other tangible material, or copies thereof, containing any information\nconcerning or disclosing any of the Confidential Information of the Company. Employee recognizes that such unauthorized taking of the\nCompany’s trade secrets can result in criminal penalties and civil liability under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act; and that willful misappropriation\nmay result in lines and an award against Employee for damages as well as the Company’s attorneys’ fees in collecting such damages, which shall\nbe in addition to, and shall not supersede, the Company’s available remedies pursuant to state and federal law.\n6. Equitable Remedies. Employee recognizes and agrees that the violation, breach or threatened violation or breach of any term,\nprovision, or condition of this Agreement may cause irreparable damage to the Company which is difficult to calculate, and that the award of any\nsum or damages may not be adequate relief to the Company. Employee therefore agrees that, in addition to all of the remedies available in the\nevent of any actual or threatened violation or breach of this Agreement, the Company shall have the right to injunctive and other equitable relief.\nHowever, no specification in this Agreement of a specific legal or equitable remedy shall be construed as a waiver of or prohibition against the\npursuit of other legal or equitable remedies in the event of the actual or threatened violation or breach of a provision of this Agreement.\n7. Cumulative Remedies. Each and all of the several rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement shall be cumulative. No one\nright or remedy shall be exclusive of the others, or of any right or remedy allowed in law or in equity. No waiver or indulgence by the Company\nof any failure by Employee to keep or perform any promise or condition of this Agreement shall be a waiver of any preceding or succeeding\nbreach of the same, or any other promise or condition. No waiver by the Company of any right shall be construed as a waiver of any other right.\nThe Company shall not be required to give notice to enforce strict adherence to all terms of this Agreement.\n8. Attorneys’ Fees. If any action is necessary to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’\nfees, costs, and expenses.\n-3-\n9. Material Condition of Employment. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the protections set forth in this Agreement are a material\ncondition to his/her employment with and compensation by the Company.\n10. Amendment and Binding Effect. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by both parties. This\nAgreement shall be binding on the heirs, executors, administrators, and other legal representatives and assigns of Employee, and is for the benefit\nof the Company and its successors and assigns.\n11. Governing Law. The laws of the State of Nevada (without giving effect to choice of law or conflict of law principles) shall govern the\nvalidity, construction, performance and effect of this Agreement, except to the extent governed by federal law, irrespective of the fact that one or\nmore of the parities now is, or may become, a resident or citizen of a different state or country. The parties hereby expressly submit to the\npersonal jurisdiction of the court or arbitral forum located in Clark County, State of Nevada, and waive any objection or defense based on\npersonal jurisdiction or venue that might otherwise be asserted to proceeding in such forum(s).\n12. Entire Understanding. This Agreement expresses the entire understanding of the parties about the described subject matter.\n13. Severability. If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of this Agreement to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, in whole\nor in part, for any reason whatsoever, the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, or portions of them, will not be affected.\n14. Employment at Will. Employment and compensation can be terminated, with or without cause, and with or without notice, at any time,\nat the option of the Company or the Employee. Nothing contained in this Confidentiality Agreement shall limit or otherwise alter the foregoing.\n15. Headings.

(""NIKE""):\nRECITALS:\nA. This Covenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is executed upon initial employment with NIKE and is a condition\nof such employment. Employee acknowledges that he/she was informed in a written job offer at least two weeks before starting work that this\nCovenant Not to Compete and Non-Disclosure Agreement is required and is a condition of employment.\nB. Over the course of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE, EMPLOYEE will be or has been exposed to and/or is in a position to\ndevelop confidential information peculiar to NIKE’s business and not generally known to the public as defined below (“Protected Information”).\nIt is anticipated that EMPLOYEE will continue to be exposed to Protected Information of greater sensitivity as EMPLOYEE advances in the\ncompany and this Agreement will remain in effect in the event EMPLOYEE advances and until EMPLOYEE leaves the company or it is\nsuperseded by a new written agreement executed by the parties.\nC. The nature of NIKE's business is highly competitive and disclosure of any Protected Information would result in severe damage to\nNIKE and be difficult to measure.\nD. NIKE makes use of its Protected Information throughout the world. Protected Information of NIKE can be used to NIKE's\ndetriment anywhere in the world.\nAGREEMENT:\nIn consideration of the foregoing, and the terms and conditions set forth below, the parties agree as follows:\n1. Covenant Not to Compete.\n(a) Competition Restriction. During EMPLOYEE’s employment by NIKE, under the terms of any employment contract or\notherwise, and for 1 year thereafter, (the “Restriction Period”), EMPLOYEE will not directly or indirectly, own, manage, control, or participate\nin the ownership, management or control of, or be employed by, consult for, or be connected in any manner with, any business engaged\nanywhere in the world in the athletic footwear, athletic apparel or sports equipment, sports electronics/technology and sports accessories\nbusiness, or any other business which directly competes with NIKE or any of its parent, subsidiaries or affiliated corporations (a “Competitor”).\nThis provision is subject to NIKE's option to waive all or any portion of the Restriction Period as more specifically provided below.\n(b) Extension of Time. In the event EMPLOYEE breaches this covenant not to compete, the Restriction Period shall\nautomatically toll from the date of the first breach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach through private settlement,\njudicial or other action, including all appeals. The Restriction Period shall continue upon the effective date of any such settlement, judicial or\nother resolution. NIKE shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE the additional compensation described in paragraph 1(d) below during any\nperiod of time in which this Agreement is tolled due to EMPLOYEE’s breach. In the event EMPLOYEE receives such additional compensation\nafter any such breach, EMPLOYEE must immediately reimburse NIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a written\nrequest by NIKE.\n(c) Waiver of Non-Compete. NIKE has the option, in its sole discretion, to elect to waive all or a portion of the Restriction\nPeriod or to limit the definition of Competitor, by giving EMPLOYEE seven (7) days prior notice of such election. In the event all or a portion of\nthe Restriction Period is waived or the definition of Competitor is limited, NIKE shall not be obligated to pay EMPLOYEE for any period of\ntime as to which the covenant not to compete has been waived.\n(d) Additional Consideration. As additional consideration for the covenant not to compete described above, should NIKE\nterminate EMPLOYEE’s employment without cause and elect to enforce the non-competition agreement, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a\nmonthly payment equal to one hundred percent (100%) of EMPLOYEE's last monthly base salary while the Restriction Period is in effect.\nExcept where prohibited by law, if Nike terminates EMPLOYEE for “cause,” no additional consideration will be owed to EMPLOYEE under\nthis Agreement and the covenant not to compete will remain enforceable. For purposes of this Agreement only, “cause” shall mean: i)\ninsubordination, (ii) acts of dishonesty, (iii) involvement in illegal activities where such involvement in illegal activities violates Nike policies,\nplaces Nike at risk or has or could damage Nike’s reputation in the community or any of its related or subsidiary companies, (iv) violation of\nNike’s anti-harassment or anti-discrimination policy, and (v) gross neglect of EMPLOYEE’S duties or willful misconduct that, in either case,\nresults in\neconomic harm to Nike or harm to Nike’s reputation. Nothing in this paragraph or Agreement alters the employment-at-will relationship\nbetween Nike and EMPLOYEE.\nIf EMPLOYEE voluntarily terminates employment and NIKE elects to enforce the non-competition agreement, NIKE shall pay EMPLOYEE a\nmonthly severance payment equal to fifty percent (50%) of EMPLOYEE’s last monthly base salary while the Restriction Period is in effect. The\nfirst payment to EMPLOYEE of additional consideration shall follow on the next applicable pay period after the election to enforce the non-\ncompetition agreement, payable in accordance with NIKE’s payroll practices.\n2. Subsequent Employer. EMPLOYEE agrees to notify NIKE at the time of separation of employment of the name of EMPLOYEE’s\nnew employer, if known. EMPLOYEE further agrees to disclose to NIKE the name of any subsequent employer during the Restriction Period,\nwherever located and regardless of whether such employer is a competitor of NIKE.\n3. Non-Disclosure Agreement.\n(a) Protected Information Defined. “Protected Information” shall mean all proprietary information, in whatever form and format, of\nNIKE and all information provided to NIKE by third parties which NIKE is obligated to keep confidential. EMPLOYEE agrees that any and all\ninformation to which EMPLOYEE has access concerning NIKE projects and internal NIKE information is Protected Information, whether in\nverbal form, machine-readable form, written or other tangible form, and whether designated as confidential or unmarked. Without limiting the\nforegoing, Protected Information includes trade secrets and competitively sensitive business or professional information (regardless of whether\nsuch information constitutes a trade secret) relating to NIKE’s research and development activities, its intellectual property and the filing or\npendency of patent applications, confidential techniques, methods, styles, designs, design concepts and ideas, customer and vendor lists, contract\nfactory lists, pricing information, manufacturing plans, business and marketing plans or strategy, product development plants, product launch\nplans, financial information, sales information, methods of operation, manufacturing processes and methods, products, and personnel\ninformation.\n(b) Excluded Information. Notwithstanding paragraph 3(a), Protected Information excludes any information that is or\nbecomes part of the public domain through no act or failure to act on the part of EMPLOYEE. Specifically, EMPLOYEE shall be permitted to\nretain as part of his or her personal portfolio copies of the EMPLOYEE’S original artwork and designs, provided the EMPLOYEE presents those\npersonal portfolio copies to his or her supervisor for review and approval and provided the artwork or designs have become part of the public\ndomain. In any dispute between the parties with respect to this exclusion, the burden of proof will be on EMPLOYEE and such proof will be by\nclear and convincing evidence.\n(c) Employee’s Obligations. During the period of employment by NIKE and for a period of two (2) years thereafter,\nEMPLOYEE will hold in confidence and protect all Protected Information and will not, at any time, directly or indirectly, use any Protected\nInformation for any purpose outside the scope of EMPLOYEE's employment with NIKE or disclose any Protected Information to any third\nperson or organization without the prior written consent of NIKE. Specifically, but not by way of limitation, EMPLOYEE will not ever copy,\ntransmit, reproduce, summarize, quote, publish or make any commercial or other use whatsoever of any Protected Information without the prior\nwritten consent of NIKE. EMPLOYEE will also take reasonable security precautions and such other actions as may be necessary to insure that\nthere is no use or disclosure, intentional or inadvertent, of Protected Information in violation of this Agreement.\n4. Return of Protected Information. At the request of NIKE at anytime, and in any event, upon termination of employment,\nEMPLOYEE shall immediately return to NIKE all Protected Information in whatever form, including tapes, notebooks, drawings, digital files, or\nother media containing Protected Information, and all copies thereof, then in EMPLOYEE's possession or under EMPLOYEE’s control.\n5. Unauthorized Use. During the period of employment with NIKE and thereafter, EMPLOYEE will notify NIKE immediately if\nEMPLOYEE becomes aware of the unauthorized possession, use or knowledge of any Protected Information by any person employed or not\nemployed by NIKE at the time of such possession, use or knowledge. EMPLOYEE will cooperate with NIKE in the investigation of any such\nincident and will cooperate with NIKE in any litigation with third parties deemed necessary by NIKE to protect the Protected Information. NIKE\nshall provide reasonable reimbursement to EMPLOYEE for each hour so engaged and that amount shall not be diminished by operation of any\npayment under Paragraph 1(d) of this Agreement.\n6. Non-Solicitation/Non-Recruitment. During the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, EMPLOYEE\nwill not directly or indirectly, solicit, divert or hire away (or attempt to solicit, divert or hire away) to or for himself or any other company or\nbusiness organization, any NIKE employee, whether or not such employee is a full-time employee or temporary employee and whether or not\nsuch employment is pursuant to a written agreement or is at will or any independent contractor working for Nike.\n7. Accounting of Profits. EMPLOYEE agrees that, if EMPLOYEE should violate any term of this Agreement, NIKE shall be entitled\nto an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation, commissions, remuneration or benefits which EMPLOYEE directly or indirectly\nhas realized and/or may realize as a result of or in connection with any such violation (including the return of any additional consideration paid\nby NIKE pursuant to Paragraph 1(d) above). Such remedy shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive relief or other rights or\nremedies to which NIKE may be entitled at law or in equity.\n8. General Provisions.\n(a) Survival. This Agreement shall continue in effect after the termination of EMPLOYEE’s employment, regardless of the\nreason for termination.\n(b) Waiver. No waiver, amendment, modification or cancellation of any term or condition of this Agreement will be effective\nunless executed in writing by both parties. No written waiver will excuse the performance of any act other than the act or acts specifically\nreferred to therein.\n(c) Severability. Each provision herein will be treated as a separate and independent clause and unenforceability of any one\nclause will in no way impact the enforceability of any other clause. Should any of the provisions in this Agreement be found to be unreasonable\nor invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be enforceable to the maximum extent enforceable by the law of that\njurisdiction.\n(d) Applicable Law/Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and EMPLOYEE's employment hereunder, shall be construed according\nto the laws of the State of Oregon. EMPLOYEE further hereby submits to the jurisdiction of, and agrees that exclusive jurisdiction over and\nvenue for any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall lie in the state and federal courts located in Oregon.\nEMPLOYEE NIKE, Inc.\n/s/ Jeanne Jackson By / s/ Mark Parker\nName: Mark Parker\nDATE March 4, 2009\nTitle: President/CEO Nike, Inc.","{""effective_date"": ""2009-03-04"", ""jurisdiction"": ""Oregon"", ""party"": [""Jeanne_Jackson"", ""Nike_Inc.""]}",1785,2

By way of illustration only, examples of NIKE competitors include but are not\nlimited to: Adidas, FILA, Reebok, Puma, Asics, Saucony, New Balance, Skechers, KSwiss, Merrell, Timberland,\nChampion, Russell, Oakley, DKNY, Ralph Lauren/Polo Sport, B.U.M ., FUBU, The Gap, Tommy Hilfiger, Umbro, The\nNorth Face, Foot Locker, The Sports Authority, Finish Line, Columbia Sportswear, Wilson, Mizuno, Callaway Golf,\nAcushnet, and Taylor Made. This provision is subject to NIKE's option to waive all or any portion of the Restriction\nPeriod as more specifically provided below. 1.2 Extension of Time. In the event that Employee breaches this\n_________________\ncovenant not to compete, the Restriction Period shall automatically toll from the date of the first\nbreach, and all subsequent breaches, until the resolution of the breach through private settlement, judicial or other action,\nincluding all appeals. The Restriction Period shall continue upon the effective date of any such settlement, judicial or\nother resolution. NIKE shall not be obligated to pay Employee the additional compensation described in paragraph 1.4\nbelow for any period of time in which this Amended and Restated Agreement is tolled due to Employee's breach. In the\nevent Employee receives such additional compensation for any such breach, Employee must immediately reimburse\nNIKE in the amount of all such compensation upon the receipt of a written request by NIKE. 1.3 Waiver of Non-\nCompete. NIKE has the option to elect to waive _____________________ all or a portion of the Restriction Period or to\nlimit the definition of Competitor, by giving Employee seven (7) days prior notice of such election; provided, however,\nunless Employee is terminated ""for cause"" (which shall only include continual and repeated neglect of duties or acts of\ndishonesty), any waiver of the Restriction Period must be with the consent of Employee. In the event all or a portion of\nthe Restriction Period is waived, NIKE shall not be obligated to pay Employee for any period of time as to which the\nCovenant Not to Compete has been waived. 1.4 Additional Consideration. __ ______________________ (a) As\nadditional consideration for the Covenant Not To Compete described above, should NIKE terminate Employee's\nemployment and the Covenant Not To Compete is enforced, NIKE shall (subject to subparagraph (b) below) pay\nEmployee a monthly payment equal to one- twelfth (1/12) of Employee's then current Annual NIKE Income (defined\nherein to mean base salary and annual Performance Sharing Plan bonus calculated at 100% of Employee's last targeted\nrate) while the Restriction Period is in effect. If Employee voluntarily terminates employment and the Covenant Not To\nCompete is enforced, NIKE shall (subject to subparagraph (b) below) pay Employee a monthly payment equal to one-\ntwenty-fourth (1/24) of Employee's then current Annual NIKE Income while the Restriction Period is in effect. (b)\nSection 409A of the Internal Revenue Code requires that the monthly payments to Employee set forth in subparagraph\n(a) above may not commence until six months after Employee's ""separation from service"" as defined in Treasury\nRegulations (Section) 1.409A -1(h). Failure to follow this requirement will result in substantial tax penalties to\nEmployee. Accordingly, the commencement of these payments will be delayed until after the six-month period following\nEmployee's separation from service in order to comply with Section 409A and avoid tax penalties for Employee. All\npayments that Employee would otherwise have received before the date that is six months after Employee's separation\nfrom service will be accumulated by NIKE and paid to Employee in a lump sum promptly following the end of the six-\nmonth period, together with interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published from time to\ntime in The Wall Street Journal on these delayed payments from the date otherwise payable under subparagraph (a) until\nthe date actually paid. 2. Subsequent Employer. Employee agrees to notify NIKE at the ___________________ time of\nseparation of employment of the name of Employee's new employer, if known. Employee further agrees to disclose to\nNIKE the name of any subsequent employer during the Restriction Period, wherever located and regardless of whether\nsuch employer is a competitor of NIKE. 3. Non-Disclosure Agreement. ________________________ 3.1 Protectable\nInformation Defined. ""Protected Information"" _______________________________ shall mean all proprietary\ninformation, in whatever form and format, of NIKE and all information provided to NIKE by third parties which NIKE\nis obligated to keep confidential.

In any dispute between the parties with\nrespect to this exclusion, the burden of proof will be on Employee and such proof will be by clear and convincing\nevidence. 3.3 Employee's Obligations.

Employee will also take reasonable security precautions and such other actions as may be\nnecessary to insure that there is no use or disclosure, intentional or inadvertent, of Protected Information in violation of\nthis Amended and Restated Agreement. 4. Return of Protected Information.

Unauthorized Use. During the period of employment with NIKE ________________ and\nthereafter, Employee will notify NIKE immediately if Employee becomes aware of the unauthorized possession, use or\nknowledge of any Protected Information by any person employed or not employed by NIKE at the time of such\npossession, use or knowledge. Employee will cooperate with NIKE in the investigation of any such incident and will\ncooperate with NIKE in any litigation with third parties deemed necessary by NIKE to protect the Protected Information.\nNIKE shall provide reasonable reimbursement to Employee for each hour so engaged and that amount shall not be\ndiminished by operation of any payment under paragraph 1.4 of this Amended and Restated Agreement. 6.

Such remedy shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive\nrelief or other rights or remedies to which NIKE may be entitled at law or in equity. 8.
